## To do

1. to make params stand alone.

2. to doc.

3. <alession note1>only the active box becomes red if there is a overlap

4. <alession note2>so if user do not move the box in the middle of pallet
then  prohibit user from adding another box?
	Button add enabled untill  the current box's color is not red, and it is placed.

## Future

1. line: approach, same position with the other box and unvisible(placed), currentbox(visible)


 horizontal line
 vertical line


note:

	rotate clockwise crossover pallet happend left and bottom

# done
1)      I think we need to use all the “canvas (white space)” we can, so fit the overhang area into the canvas area in order to have bigger items ()always keeping up proportions )
5)      Using the app I think will be faster for the user if you create the box over the last one placed


# to do
2)      The coordinates x y are referred to a corner of the box, we need to see the center coordinates


3)      Even the rotations must be around the center


4)      Another things about rotations, implement the rotations 90, 180, 270 because we will probably in the future need to add  “labels” to the box so we will need all the rotations I think. Maybe you can add a little colored corner to the box to understand from the draw the rotation. It’s only a suggestion



6)      This point is a new development, its possible to drag and drop the box with the mouse? Because we are doing tests on hardware and out
        touchscreen allows to intercept finger scrolls do slide effects, so we probably will be able to do drag and drops

        ###PLACED box cannot be dragged.
so if I want to dragging a box,
select this box first.###
